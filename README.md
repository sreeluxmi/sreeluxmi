 👋 hey yooo

I write code. Mostly Python/Django.   
I solve problems, and outside the screen I (rarely) read, sketch a little, enjoy good food, and just live, occasionally pretending to be an adult.

## what you’ll find here
- 🛠️ APIs and backend systems I’ve worked on.
- 🎲 random experiments (ideas I like to test, some make it further than others).
- 💤 repos in progress (because not every idea deserves production).
- 🍕 maybe something fun & useless

## fun fact
You won’t see every square green on my GitHub graph.
